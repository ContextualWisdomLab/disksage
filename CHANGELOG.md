# Changelog

All notable changes to DiskSage are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and released versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Align the frontend toolchain on Vite 8.2 and `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` 7.2 so the declared peer dependency graph is installable and reproducible.
- Declare the supported Node.js runtime floor as Node.js 20.19 or Node.js 22.12 and later, matching Vite 8 requirements.
- Pin the primary test workflow to Node.js 20.19.0 so the minimum supported runtime is continuously verified.

### Security

- Generate the npm lockfile in an exact-head validation job with repository contents read-only and dependency lifecycle scripts disabled, bind the artifact to SHA-256 evidence, and grant `contents: write` only to a separate publication job that verifies the same-run artifact and unchanged branch head before committing the lockfile.
